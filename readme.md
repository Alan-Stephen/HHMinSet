# Plans
## Objective
 - Create a learning hyper-hueristic optimistion approach to solving the min-sat problem
 - using hueristic selection and elaborate move acceptence.
## Current Approach
 - reinforcement learning for the hyper hueristic, have a set of hueristics to choose from
 - with simulated annealing as the move acceptence method.
 - maybe have multiple hill climbing methods to choose from, multiple mutations to choose from.
